===================

Javascript mortgage calculator and payment tables printout that includes Canadian rules

This calculator allows you to specify either the amount of each payment, or the amortization in years. 
Payments can be on a weekly, biweekly, semi-monthly, or a monthly basis. 

You can specify whether compounding follows the Canadian formula (semi-annually, or 2 compounding intervals per year), 
or the American (monthly, or 12 compounding intervals per year).

For variable rate mortages, simple interest (no compounding) is usually used, so this option should be selected.

The calculator can generate a table with details of each payment, over ranging from 3 months to 10 years, 
or for the entire amortization interval.

If you find this calculator useful, and especially if it helps you to save money, 
a contribution would be much appreciated!
